Yet, one can usually set CPU and memory limits in helm charts or Kubernetes primitives. Thus nbam takes care of rewriting those to the corresponding pod annotations in multiple modes.</p>"},{"location":"#features","title":"Features","text":"<p>By adding specific labels to namespaces, NBAM mutates pod definitions accordingly to the features enabled.</p> <p>These mutations occur before the object's persistence by the apiserver. Thus, the kube-scheduler and CNI can use the object without further changes.</p> <p>Currently available features are:</p> <ul> <li>Annotator Mode</li> <li>Overwrite Mode</li> <li>Strip Mode</li>
